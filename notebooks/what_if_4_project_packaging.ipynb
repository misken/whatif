In order to create a new model, we'd probably copy the code from this class and make the changes specific to the new model in terms of its variables (class attributes) and formulas (class methods). However, every model class (as we've conceived it so far) also needs to have an `update` method that takes a dictionary of model variable names (the keys) and their new values. Rather than the modeler having to remember to do this, it makes more sense to create a generic `Model` *base class* from which our specific model classes will *inherit* things like an `update` method. I also moved the `__str__` function into our new `Model` base class.\n",

Not only does this help with model debugging and readability, it provides an easy way to analyze components of composite quantities. For example, `sales_revenue` is based on the number of units sold and the selling price per unit. Our original implemenation buried the computation of number sold into the `sales_revenue` function. This makes it tough to do things like sensitivity analysis on number sold. So, we'll rework the class a bit to add some new methods.

For our purposes, we will just be considering *regular packages* and discuss a standard purpose and use of `__init__.py`. **This file, which is often blank, when placed into a folder, marks this folder as a regular package.** When this folder is imported, any code in `__init__.py` is executed. Here is the `__init__.py` file for the `whatif` package.\n",

After we install the `whatif` package (which we'll get to shortly), we could always import it for use in a Jupyter notebook with the statements like those above.
