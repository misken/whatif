However, every model class (as we've conceived it so far) also needs to have an `update` method that takes a dictionary of model variable names (the keys) and their new values. Rather than the modeler having to remember to do this, it makes more sense to create a generic `Model` *base class* from which our specific model classes will *inherit* things like an `update` method.

Not only does this help with model debugging and readability, it provides an easy way to analyze components of composite quantities. For example, `sales_revenue` is based on the number of units sold and the selling price per unit. Our original implemenation buried the computation of number sold into the `sales_revenue` function.
