These templates are then used throughout the specific cookiecutter's example folder structure and cookiecutter program is just doing a big Search and Replace and filling in templates with their values. That's it. Simple but very powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different types of Python people created different cookiecutters (i.e. templates) designed for their type of projects and their workflow and tool preferences.

    "\n",
    "As was intended in the cookiecutter world, other people cloned the [Cookiecutter Data Science template from GitHub](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) and modified it to better suit their needs. One notable such template was developed by the Molecular Sciences Software Institute for their [Python Packages Best Practices](https://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/) set of tutorials which are modeled after the Software Carpentry tutorials. We will use some materials from this MolSSI Tutorial. In their [very first lesson](https://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/01-package-setup/index.html) they walk you through creating a new project structure from their [CMS Cookiecutter](https://github.com/MolSSI/cookiecutter-cms).

    "Everything we've done so far has used the one specific model class we created - `BookstoreModel`. In order to create a new model, we'd probably copy the code from this class and make the changes specific to the new model in terms of its variables (class attributes) and formulas (class methods). However, every model class (as we've conceived it so far) also needs to have an `update` method that takes a dictionary of model variable names (the keys) and their new values. Rather than the modeler having to remember to do this, it makes more sense to create a generic `Model` *base class* from which our specific model classes will *inherit* things like an `update` method. I also moved the `__str__` function into our new `Model` base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three of the analysis functions we created (`data_table`, `goal_seek` and `simulate`) rely on this specific implementation of `update` and require a model object as an input argument. Given that, it makes sense to move these functions from their current place as *module level* functions to class methods of the new base class, `Model`. You can find this new `Model` base class within `whatif.py` at the [whatif project GitHub site](https://github.com/misken/whatif).\n",

    "Anyone who builds spreadsheet models knows that it's usually better to decompose large formulas into smaller peices. Not only does this help with model debugging and readability, it provides an easy way to analyze components of composite quantities. For example, `sales_revenue` is based on the number of units sold and the selling price per unit. Our original implemenation buried the computation of number sold into the `sales_revenue` function. This makes it tough to do things like sensitivity analysis on number sold. So, we'll rework the class a bit to add some new methods.

We'll try out our package on a new model and sketch out some ideas for future enhancements to the package. It's important we also start creating some basic documentation and a user guide."
