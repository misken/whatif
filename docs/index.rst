whatif documentation!
==============================================

The whatif package helps you build business analysis oriented models in Python that you might normally build in Excel. 
Specifically, whatif includes functions that are similar to Excel's Data Tables and Goal Seek for doing
sensitivity analysis and "backsolving" (e.g. finding a breakeven point). It also includes functions
for facilitating Monte-Carlo simulation using these models.
